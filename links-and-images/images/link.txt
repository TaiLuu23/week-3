Guys, I was driving while Aleksa explained and I missed, how do I make a link for website?
From Bernardo Arrechea BrÃ¶ndsted to Everyone 10:44 PM
go to your GitHub page, then Settings, search for Pages (it's on the  left aside bar)
From Natalie Lind to Everyone 10:44 PM
clone the repository of your CSS project, go to the repository settings, click pages on the left, deploy from a branch > main > root, then creat a custom URL and refresh the oage. It should show the link at the top. Hope that helps!

Yes, make sure you're only uploading the specific folder like "main css" to a new repository, then once you make a custom url refresh the page and see if a link popped up in the top. It kept happening to me too until I refreshed
From Linah Hossam to Everyone 11:10 PM
i'll try again thank youu
